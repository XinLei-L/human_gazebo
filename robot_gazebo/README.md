# Introduction
---
A package containing custom turlebot2 URDF configuration files, maps, Gazebo worlds, and navigation parameter files for our paper ["DRL-VO: Learning to Navigate Through Crowded Dynamic Scenes Using Velocity Obstacles"](
https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2023.3257549
)([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06512.pdf)) in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2023, and ["Towards Safe Navigation Through Crowded Dynamic Environments"](
https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636102
) in IROS 2021, which is modified from https://github.com/naiij/robot-gazebo.git.
These files can be used in different Turtlebot2 navigation applications.
Detailed usage can be found at our [DRL-VO control policy](https://github.com/TempleRAIL/drl_vo_nav.git).

## Requirements
